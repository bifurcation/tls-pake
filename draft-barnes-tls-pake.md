--- abstract

The pre-shared key mechanism available in TLS 1.3 is not suitable
for usage with low-entropy keys, such as passwords entered by users.
This document describes an extension that enables the use of
password-authenticated key exchange protocols with TLS 1.3.

# Introduction

DISCLAIMER: This is a work-in-progress draft and has not yet
seen significant security analysis. It should not be used as a basis
for building production systems.

In some applications, it is desireable to enable a client and server
to authenticate to one another using a low-entropy pre-shared value,
such as a user-entered password.

In prior versions of TLS, this functionality has been provided by
the integration of the Secure Remote Password PAKE protocol (SRP)
{{?RFC5054}}.  The specific SRP integration described in RFC 5054
does not immediately extend to TLS 1.3 because it relies on the
Client Key Exchange and Server Key Exchange messages, which no
longer exist in 1.3.

TLS 1.3 itself provides a mechanism for authentication with
pre-shared keys (PSKs).  However, PSKs used with this protocol need
to be "full-entropy", because the binder values used for
authentication can be used to mount a dictionary attack on the PSK.
So while the TLS 1.3 PSK mechanism is suitable for the session
resumption cases for which it is specified, it cannot be used when
the client and server share only a low-entropy secret.

Enabling TLS to address this use case effectively requires the TLS
handshake to execute a password-authenticated key establishment
(PAKE) protocol.  This document describes a TLS extension `pake`
that can carry data necessary to execute a PAKE.

This extension is generic, in that it can be used to carry key
exchange information for multiple different PAKEs. The client and
server may negotiated the PAKE algorithm, and any required
parameters. As a first case, this document defines a concrete
protocol for executing the SPAKE2+ PAKE protocol
{{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-spake2}}.

# Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{!RFC2119}}.

The mechanisms described in this document also apply to DTLS 1.3
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}}, but for brevity, we will refer only to TLS
throughout.

# TLS Extensions

A client offers to authenticate with PAKE by including a `pake`
extension in its ClientHello.  The content of this exension is a
`PAKEClientHello` value, providing a list of `client_shares`.
Each `client_share` contains PAKE algorithm type and associated
paraemters, client identity and the client's first message from
the underlying PAKE protocol.

Clients MAY send an empty client_shares vector in order to request
PAKE algorithm selection from the server, at the cost of an
additional round trip.

If a client sends the `pake` extension, then it MAY also send the
`key_share` and `pre_shared_key` extensions, to allow the server to
choose an authentication mode.  Unlike PSK-based authentication,
however, authentication with PAKE cannot be combined with the
normal TLS ECDH mechanism.  Forward secrecy is provided by the PAKE
itself.

~~~~~
struct {
    PAKEGroup group;
    opaque identity<0..2^16-1>;
    opaque pake_message<1..2^16-1>;
} PAKEShare;

struct {
    PAKEShare client_shares<0..2^16-1>;
} PAKEClientHello;

struct {
    PAKEAlgorithm algorithm;
} PAKEGroup;

enum {
   [[TO BE DEFINED]]
PAKEAlgorithm;

~~~~~

A server that receives a `pake` extension examines the list of
client shares to see if there is one with a PAKE algorithm that
the server supports and an identity the server recognizes.  If
so, the server may indicate its choice of PAKE authentication by
including a `pake` extension in its ServerHello.  The content of
this exension is a `PAKEServerHello` value including a `PAKEShare`.
The `PAKEShare` specifyies the PAKE algorithm, the identity
value for the password the server has selected, and the server's
first message in the PAKE protocol.

Use of PAKE authenication is compatible with standard
certificate-based authentication of both clients and servers.  If a
server includes an `pake` extension in its ServerHello, it may still
send the Certificate and CertificateVerify messages, and/or send a
CertificateRequest message to the client.

If a server uses PAKE authentication, then it MUST NOT send an
extension of type `key_share`, `pre_shared_key`, or `early_data`.

~~~~~
struct {
    PAKEShare server_share;
} PAKEServerHello;
~~~~~

Based on the messages exchanged in the ClientHello and ServerHello,
the client and server execute the specified PAKE protocol to derive
a shared key.  This key is used as the `ECHD(E)` input to the TLS
1.3 key schedule.

As with client authentication via certificates, the server has not
authenticated the client until after it has received the client's
Finished message.  When a server negotiates the use of this
mechanism for authentication, it MUST NOT send application data
before it has received the client's Finished message.


# Compatible PAKE Protocols

In order to be usable with the `pake` extension, a PAKE protocol
must specify some syntax for its messages, and the protocol itself
must be compatible with the message flow described above.  A
specification describing the use of a particular PAKE protocol with
TLS must provide the following details:

* Parameters that must be pre-provisioned
* Content of the `pake_message` field in a ClientHello
* Content of the `pake_message` field in a ServerHello
* How the PAKE protocol is executed based on those messages
* How the outputs are of the PAKE protocol are used to populate the
  `PSK` and `ECDH(E)` inputs to the TLS key schedule.

The underlying cryptographic protocol must be compatible with the
message flow described above:

* It must be possible to execute in one round-trip, with the client
  speaking first
* The Finished MAC must provide sufficient key confirmation for the
  protocol, taking into account the contents of the handshake
  messages

In addition, to be compatible with the security requirements of TLS
1.3, PAKE protocols defined for use with TLS 1.3 MUST provide
forward secrecy.

Several current PAKE protocols satisfy these requirements, for
example:

* SPAKE2+ (described below) {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-spake2}}
* SPEKE and derivatives such as Dragonfly {{speke}} {{?I-D.harkins-tls-dragonfly}}
* OPAQUE {{opaque}}
* SRP {{?RFC2945}}


# SPAKE2+ Implementation

# Pre-provisioned Parameters

In order to use SPAKE2+, a TLS client and server need to have
pre-provisioned the values required to execute the SPAKE2+ protocol
(see Section 3.1 of {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-spake2}}):

* A DH group of order `p*h`, with `p` a large prime, and generator
  `G`
* Fixed elements `M` and `N` for the group
* A hash function `H`
* A password `pw`

Note that the hash function `H` might be different from the hash
function associated with the ciphersuite negotiated by the two
parties.  The hash function `H` MUST be a hash function suitable for
hashing passwords, e.g., Argon2 or scrypt {{?I-D.irtf-cfrg-argon2}}
{{?RFC7914}}.

The TLS client and server roles map to the `A` and `B` roles in the
SPAKE2+ specification, respectively.  The identity of the server is
the domain name sent in the `server_name` extension of the
ClientHello message.  The identity of the client is an opaque octet
string, specified in the `spake2` ClientHello extension, defined
below.

From the shared password, each party computes two shared integers
`w0` and `w1` by running the following algorithm twice (changing the
`context` value each time):

~~~~~
struct {
  uint16 context;
  opaque client\_identity<0..255>;
  opaque server\_name<0..255>;
  opaque password<0..255>;
} PasswordInput;
~~~~~

* Encode the following values into a `PasswordInput` structure:
  * `client_identity`: The client's identity, as described above.
  * `server_name`: The server's identity, as described above.
  * `password`: The password `pw`
  * `context`: One of the following values:
    * 0x7730, when generating `w0`
    * 0x7731, when generating `w1`

* Use the hash function `H` with the encoded `PasswordInput`
  structure as input to derive an `n`-byte string, where `n` is the
  byte-length of `p`.

* Interpret the `n`-bit string as an integer `w` in network byte
  order.  Return the result `(w % p) * h` of reducing `w` mod p and
  multiplying it by `h`.

Servers MUST store only the value `w0` and the product `L = w1*G`,
where `G` is the fixed generator of the group.  Clients will need to
have access to the values `w0` and `w1` directly, but SHOULD
generate these values dynamically, rather than caching them.


# Content of the TLS Extensions

The content of a `pake_message` in a ClientHello is the client's key
share `T`.  The value `T` is computed as specified in
{{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-spake2}}, as `T = w*M + X`, where `M` is a fixed
value for the DH group and `X` is the public key of a fresh DH key
pair.  The format of the key share `T` is the same as for a
`KeyShareEntry.key_exchange` value from the same group.

The content of a `pake_message` in a ServerHello is the server's key
share `S`.  The value `S` is computed as specified in
{{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-spake2}}, as `S = w*N + Y`, where `N` is a fixed
value for the DH group and `Y` is the public key of a fresh DH key
pair.  The format of the key share `S` is the same as for a
`KeyShareEntry.key_exchange` value from the same group.

Based on these messages, both the client and server can compute the
two shared values as specified in {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-spake2}}.

| Name | Value    | Client          | Server         |
|:-----|:---------|:----------------|:---------------|
| Z    | x\*y\*G  | x\*(S - w0\*N)  | x\*(T - w0\*M) |
| V    | w1\*y\*G | w1\*(S - w0\*N) | y\*L           |

The following value is used as the `(EC)DHE` input to the TLS 1.3
key schedule:

~~~~~
K = H(Z || V)
~~~~~

Here `H` is the hash function corresponding to the TLS cipher suite
in use and `||` represents concatenation of octet strings.


# Security Considerations

Many of the security properties of this protocol will derive from
the PAKE protocol being used.  Security considerations for PAKE
protocols are noted in {{compatible-pake-protocols}}.

The mechanism defined in this document does not provide protection
for the client's identity, in contrast to TLS client authentication
with certificates.

TLS servers that offer this mechanism can be used by third party
attackers as an oracle for two questions:

1. Whether the server knows about a given identity
2. Whether the server recognizes a given (identity, password) pair

The former is signaled by whether the server returns a `pake`
extension.  

[[TODO: Similar to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054#section-2.5.1.3, the server could run through a complete handshake calculation and fail at the end so that the attacker only knows that the identity/password pair is incorrect, but does not know if the identity is recognized or not. This requires that the server can interpret the pake_message and ascertain the associated PAKE algorithm, group parameters, etc., which requires a reworking of some text in this draft as the identity is currently defined as providing a map to said group parameters. This is related to the discussion in the Open Items section.]]

The latter is signaled by whether the connection
succeeds.  These oracles are all-or-nothing: If the attacker does
not have the correct identity or password, he does not learn
anything about the correct value.


## Security when using SPAKE2+

For the most part, the security properties of the password-based
authentication described in this document are the same as those
described in the Security Considerations of
{{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-spake2}}.  The TLS Finished MAC provides the key
confirmation required for the security of the protocol.  Note that
all of the elements covered by the example confirmation hash listed
in that document are also covered by the Finished MAC:

* `A`, `B`, and `T` are included via the ClientHello
* `S` via the ServerHello
* `K`, and `w` via the TLS key schedule

The `x` and `y` values used in the SPAKE2 protocol MUST have the
same ephemerality properties as the key shares sent in the
`key_shares` extension.  In particular, `x` and `y` MUST NOT be
equal to zero.   This ensures that TLS sessions using SPAKE2 have
the same forward secrecy properties as sessions using the normal TLS
(EC)DH mechanism.

# Open Items

## PAKE Algorithm Negotiation

It is possible that a client may know the password to use, but may not know in advance which PAKE protocols(s) a particular server supports. A potential solution to this is similar to TLS1.3 ClientHello `key_share` operation: the client may send an empty `client_shares` vector in its PAKEClientHello extension. The server can then send an HelloRetryRequest indicating which PAKE protocol, and associated group parameters, the client should use. The client then sends another ClientHello that includes `pake_message` in the PAKEClientHello extension calculated using the correct algorithm. This requires definition of a suitable field for transporting PAKE algorithm and group parameters.

As an optimisation, similar to TLS1.3 key_share operation, the client could guess the PAKE protocol and include a `pake_message` derived from its guess in the initial ClientHello. If the server does not support the selected PAKE protcol (or protocol group parameter, etc.), the server can send an HelloRetryRequest indicating the supported PAKE protocol and group parameters. Note: it is TBD if sending two different `pake_messages` derived from two different protocol and/or group parameters in two different ClientHello messages constitutes a significant attack vector. This needs cryptographic review.
